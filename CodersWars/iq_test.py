# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers
# differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
# Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one
# that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
#
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
# which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

#     numbers_array = numbers.split()
#     print(numbers_array)

#     even_num = []
#     for i in numbers_array:
#         if int(i) % 2 == 0:
#             even_num.append(i)
#         else:
#             odd_num.append(i)
#     if len(odd_num) == 1:
#         return numbers_array.index(odd_num[0]) +1
