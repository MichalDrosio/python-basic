# Return the most profit from stock quotes.
#
# â€‚Stock quotes are stored in an array in order of date.
# The stock profit is the difference in prices in buying and selling stock.
# Each day, you can either buy one unit of stock, sell any number of stock units you have already bought,
# or do nothing. Therefore, the most profit is the maximum difference of all pairs in a sequence of stock prices.
#
# @param {array} quotes
# @return {number} max profit
# Example:
#
#  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]   => 15  (buy at 1,2,3,4,5 and then sell all at 6)
#  [ 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]   => 0   (nothing to buy)
#  [ 1, 6, 5, 10, 8, 7 ] => 18  (buy at 1,6,5 and sell all at 10)
